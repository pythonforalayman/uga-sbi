<p>UGA's Society of Business Intelligence organization (SBI) began in the Fall of 2016 as an organization aimed at promoting Business Intelligence within the Terry and Business community. SBI isn't only for Terry Majors however. 
<br />
<br />
There are countless opportunities to utilize the technology and skills learned in a Business Intelligence (BI) environment to your field. Business Intelligence utilizes the growing repository of Big Data that universities, organizations, and businesses collect to garner insight to some of our most pertinent problems.

    SBI ran a networking and educational panel with top professors from UGA's Terry College of Business to answer impactful questions about the rise of data analytics, business intelligence, and technology in today's day and age. We gained a large turnout and are excited for similar events this year.
