If you are interested in a leadership position for next year, come out to SBI's Exec Board Info Session tonight at Sanford 212 at 6:30PM (if you can't make it today, there is another one tomorrow at the same time and place)! If you are interested in getting more information about the specific positions open & also want to get feedback from current exec members, make sure to come out. Attending the sessions will be extremely beneficial for anyone who wants to apply, and we will also have snacks and drinks! Feel free to reach out to us via email at ugasbi16@gmail.com if you have any further questions. Please keep in mind that the deadline for applications is March 30 at 5PM. Can't wait to hear from you all! 


**These meetings go towards getting badges!**
